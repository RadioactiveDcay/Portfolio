# Portfolio

Welcome! My name is Truman. (True-men)

I love the outdoors and taking pictures as well as playing video games when I can. My favorite part of video games is learning and understanding how they work. Before taking this class I was working towards learning how to make mobile games via Unity and the C# (C-Sharp) coding language. I then found more interest in the coding languages in general and watned to pursue another career in software engineering.

Most of this portfolio was done in stages but is still a work in progess. 

I included the .old files for both the html and css to show where I transitioned from. I took most of the knowledge from Easy Tutorials video link and then modified as I saw fit. For example, they chose to hyperlink their html file to aonther website. Instead I chose to download free png files from another website and then include them in this website.

There was some headache trying to start from scratch after spending a couple hourds on the first design.
I enjoy this one a lot more and will work to making a header box that acts like a parallaxed image. but is mostly just a picture in the background with a sliding page over it to transition along seemlessly.

Currently a work in progress.
